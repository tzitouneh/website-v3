          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I’ve learned
            communication, problem solving, and time management skills. My favorite game has to be
            Trials Fusion. It has a steep learning curve, but once you understand the
            physics and how your bike interacts with the various platforms, the game becomes very
            rewarding. It can feel random at times, but once you understand the techniques being
            used then it's just a matter of practice and the results are repeatable. The game has
            a lot of challenges and it seems impossible at first, but watching the leaderboards
            and other people’s attempts motivates you because it shows that it can be done.

          <h3>Tech</h3>
          <p>
            My first console was the Game Boy Advance. This was the beginning of my fascination
            with technology. From then on I’ve accumulated more consoles like the Nintendo DS,
            Wii, PSP, PS3, PS4, and eventually I decided I would build my own computer to play
            video games. This opened up a whole new door. I learned about the various components
            that are needed and how they all communicate with each other. Seeing how you could
            customize your computer to your needs juxtaposed the uniformity of consoles. Building
            my first computer was such a memorable experience, and I recommend everyone doing it
            at least once.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy studying history and theology, and when I can, write research papers on topics
            I'm passionate about. Recently, I’ve been spreading awareness about the genocide
            happening in ChinaI where three million Uyghurs are in concentration camps. They are
            forced to denounce their religion, and are not allowed to practice their religion how
            they are meant to be. Women are being sterilized and raped. Families are separated.
            And there's mass torture. I’ve been trying to set up an event on campus on this and
            how we can help.
